                        the oldest
                        religious building in South America, known as the "Temple of the Sun". Currently you can see the
                        wonderful Inca architecture linked to Spanish architecture which is a sample of our mestizo

                        Cusco workers and

                        Saqsayhuaman: It is one of the Inca constructions that most astonishes tourists who, according
                        to new hypotheses, point out that it would have been an important Inca ceremonial center and not
                        a fortress as previously believed. Its construction took more than seven decades and required
                        the strength of about 20,000 men.<br>
                        <strong>Qenqo:</strong> Ceremonial and ritual center, it was an amphitheater where sacrifices

                        said that it was an Inca shrine. Its construction is made of stones. There are passages, canals
                        and staircases with engravings that represent the cougar, a very sacred animal for the
                        Incas.<br>
                        <strong>Puca Pucara:</strong> Former tambo guard place along the Inca roads, this archaeological
                        site has:

                        in synthesis the urban layout is highly adequate and functional.<br>
                        <strong>Tambomachay:</strong> Through its stairways you can see crystalline waterfalls and,
                        according to what is
