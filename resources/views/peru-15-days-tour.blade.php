                        the oldest
                        religious building in South America, known as the "Temple of the Sun". Currently you can see the
                        wonderful Inca architecture linked to Spanish architecture which is a sample of our mestizo
                        culture.
                        <strong>The Cathedral:</strong> The Cathedral Basilica of the city of Cusco was built by native

                        who, according
                        to new hypotheses, point out that it would have been an important Inca ceremonial center and not
                        a fortress as previously believed. Its construction took more than seven decades and required
                        the strength of about 20,000 men.<br>
                        <strong>Qenqo:</strong> Ceremonial and ritual center, it was an amphitheater where sacrifices
                        were made, it is
                        said that it was an Inca shrine. Its construction is made of stones. There are passages, canals
                        and staircases with engravings that represent the cougar, a very sacred animal for the Incas.
                        <strong>Puca Pucara: </strong> tambo guard place along the Inca roads, this archaeological site
                        has:
                        enclosures, interior plazas, baths, aqueducts, watchtowers and an easily recognizable Inca trail
                        in synthesis the urban layout is highly adequate and functional.<br>
                        <strong>Tambomachay: </strong> its stairways you can see crystalline waterfalls and, according
                        to what is
                        affirmed here, the liquid element for the Incas, "the water", was worshiped.
